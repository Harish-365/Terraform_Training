# Why is the NAT Gateway in a Public Subnet?
# âœ” NAT Gateways require an Elastic IP (EIP), which means they need to be in a subnet that can connect to the Internet Gateway (IGW).
# âœ” A private subnet cannot directly communicate with the internet, so it routes requests through the NAT Gateway in the public subnet.
# âœ” Private subnet instances use routing tables to send outbound requests to the NAT Gateway.
# Recap:
# âœ… VPC is private by design, but it contains both public and private subnets.
# âœ… The NAT Gateway sits in a public subnet because it needs an EIP to reach the internet.
# âœ… Instances in private subnets send traffic to the NAT Gateway to access the internet, while remaining inaccessible from external inbound traffic.
